## Concept

The aim is to defeat the enemies and escape the haunted dungeon! There are three enemies that have come to haunt you from the undead.

## Goal and Description

The goal is to defeat the three different types of enemies. There is a zombie that is Artificially intelligent. It has different states depending on its distance from the player. It also has wanderpoints that it roams around until the player approaches it and it attacks.  There is a skeleton enemy that drops shield loots when killed. There is also a coffin enemy that does more damage thus its shackle-ball loot provides the player with even more health. There are also fun baskets that the player can interact with and use a different projectile at. Once you shoot it drops and gets destroyed. It is a side quest that is almost like a haunted basketball.

## Core Mechanics

The zombie shoots three different types of spells. Each differ in damage and are randomly chosen. There are different moving objects and some interactables. There are two projectiles the player can shoot, one at the buckets and the other at the enmies. The loot can be picked up, and the buckets can be knocked down. The player can run around the mansion and kill the enemies using the projectiles. The enemies are spawned at random locations at a fixed frequency that increases in each level.

## Controls and UI

You can use the arrow keys or WASD to control the player, the mouse is used to change the camera angles, and the space is to jump. There is a heart and slidebar that indicates the current health of the player on the bottom left of the screen. The enemies decrease the health and the loot increases it. There is a crosshair that turns purple when targeted at an enemy and red when targeted at the interactable basket. The score is the number of enemies deafeted and that is kept track on the top left of the screen.

Levels
Level 1: This is the simplest level. You only need to defeat the zombie to go on to the next level. 
Level 2: You start this level on a crate. You must hop off the crate and defeat the two types of enemies. You need to defeat only a couple to move on to the next level. 
Level 3: This is the hardest level. You need to defeat a large number of enemies to beat the game and they spawn at a higher frequency. There is also a moving platform that can help you escape from the enemies since they cannot hop on it.

Each level has a certain number of interactable buckets but they increase in numbers in each level to add an extra level of interactability with the game world.
